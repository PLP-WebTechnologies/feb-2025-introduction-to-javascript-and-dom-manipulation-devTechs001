# Introduction to JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Objectives

- Write basic JavaScript functions.
- Manipulate the DOM dynamically.
- Respond to user interactions.

## Instructions

- Create a script.js file and link it to a HTML.
- Structure the document using DOCTYPE, html, head, and body.

>[!NOTE]
>  - Write JavaScript that:
>  - Changes text content dynamically.
>  - Modifies CSS styles via JavaScript.
>  - Adds or removes an element when a button is clicked.


## Tasks
- Create a well-structured HTML5 document.
- Use at least 5 different HTML elements.
- Ensure semantic correctness.

## Implementation

This project demonstrates JavaScript and DOM manipulation through an interactive web page. The implementation includes:

### Files
- `index.html`: A well-structured HTML5 document with semantic elements
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing DOM manipulation functionality

### Features

1. **Dynamic Text Content**
   - Click the "Change Text" button to cycle through different text messages
   - Demonstrates changing text content dynamically with JavaScript

2. **CSS Style Modification**
   - "Change Color" button cycles through different background colors for the color box
   - "Change Size" button toggles between two different sizes for the color box
   - Shows how JavaScript can modify CSS properties on-the-fly

3. **Element Manipulation**
   - "Add Element" button creates and appends new elements to the DOM
   - "Remove Element" button removes the most recently added element
   - Each added element has its own click event that toggles highlighting
   - Demonstrates adding and removing elements dynamically

### HTML Elements Used
- Semantic sectioning: `<header>`, `<section>`
- Headings: `<h1>`, `<h2>`
- Text content: `<p>`
- Grouping: `<div>`
- Interactive elements: `<button>`

### How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Interact with the buttons to see the JavaScript functionality in action


## What I've Done

I've successfully completed the JavaScript and DOM Manipulation assignment by:

1. **Creating a Well-Structured Project**
   - Developed a clean, organized HTML5 document with proper structure
   - Created a separate JavaScript file for better code organization
   - Added CSS styling for improved user experience

2. **Implementing All Required Functionality**
   - **Dynamic Text Content**: Created a system that cycles through different text messages when a button is clicked
   - **CSS Style Manipulation**: Implemented color and size changes for elements using JavaScript
   - **DOM Element Management**: Built functionality to add and remove elements dynamically

3. **Adding Interactive Features**
   - Made dynamically added elements interactive with click events
   - Created a color-changing system that cycles through multiple colors
   - Implemented size toggling for visual elements

4. **Using Semantic HTML**
   - Used appropriate semantic elements throughout the document
   - Organized content into logical sections
   - Ensured the document follows HTML5 best practices

5. **Testing and Verification**
   - Tested all interactive features to ensure they work as expected
   - Verified that the implementation meets all the requirements specified in the assignment

The implementation demonstrates my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation techniques, and event handling in web applications.
